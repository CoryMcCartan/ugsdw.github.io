Today, the Regional Director of the NLRB in Minneapolis published a decision about our
[recent hearing and case](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/18-RC-228797).  For two straight
days, the College and its union-busting lawyers tried to argue that unionization would
ruin the College's educational mission and harm students.  The NLRB rejected their argument,
calling it "unpersuasive" and "unavailing."

A secret ballot election has been scheduled for Tuesday, November 27, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
in JRC 101.  More information about the election will follow shortly.
