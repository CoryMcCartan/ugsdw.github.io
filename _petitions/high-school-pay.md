title: Pay High School Students the Contract Wage
---

Dear President Kington:

We call on you to treat the high school employees of Dining Services the same
as the college student employees. The high school workers work the same shifts
and perform the same duties as their college-aged colleagues and yet are not
paid the same wage: they make $8.50 an hour as opposed to $9.25 for college
students, in addition to being ineligible for bonuses. In addition to being
morally untenable, the college signed a contract in October that clearly
covered high school workers, making this a legal issue as well. We demand that
you end this disparity in treatment, and start paying high school workers their
due and provide them with back pay to compensate for lost wages and bonuses
from October 1, 2016 until now.
