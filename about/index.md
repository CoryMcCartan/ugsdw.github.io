# About

The only independent undergraduate labor union in the country, UGSDW fights for
fair pay and benefits for workers at Grinnell College.

# History

The Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers was started in the spring of 2016
to represent the low-skill workers in the dining hall.  After the union filed a
petition with the National Labor Relations Board in April, an election was held
to determine whether workers wanted the union to represent them. Employees
overwhelmingly chose to be represented by the union, voting in favor by a 91%
margin.

# Leadership

The union has four elected officers, who each serve a term of one year.

**Cory McCartan** *President*

**Alec Doss** *Vice President*

**Quinn Ercolani** *Treasurer*

**Rachel Bass** *Secretary*
